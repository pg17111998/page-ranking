<h1> <center> CONSTRUCTOR </center> </h1>
<p>
In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.
It is called when an instance of the object is created, and memory is allocated for the object.

It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

When is a constructor called
Every time an object is created using new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
It calls a default constructor.

Note: It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation. 
It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. 
It is because java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesn't have any.
