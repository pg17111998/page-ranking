<h1> <center> POLYMORPHISM </center> </h1>
<p>
Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. 
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. 
So polymorphism means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. 
Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.
